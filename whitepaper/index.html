                We have developed an online tool, CoalMap (coalmap.com), to help activists, regulators, and the general public explore the economic costs of existing coal-fired power plants in the United States. Drawing from publicly available datasets, the tool identifies U.S. coal plants that are particularly vulnerable to shutdown efforts by comparing each plant’s average operating cost to the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for new utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation in the same location. Users can apply different carbon prices and rates of cost decline for solar and wind, and observe the effects on the cost-competitiveness of renewable generation in future years. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained technology improvement and appropriate public policy in shifting the U.S. electricity generation mix toward low-carbon sources, and ultimately in achieving national climate-change mitigation targets. With projected rates of renewable cost decline and a carbon price equal to the U.S. government’s social cost of carbon, new solar PV and wind generation will be cost-competitive with fully amortized U.S. coal plants within the next 15 years.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <h2>Coal Power in the United States</h2>
            <p>
                In 1882, Thomas Edison built the first coal-fired power plant in the United States, the 600 kW Pearl Street Station plant in New York City.i Since that first demonstration, burning coal has become the world’s preferred method for generating electricity at low cost. Today, coal is the single largest fuel source for electricity production in the U.S. and worldwide.ii,iii By 2013, there were 518 active coal plants in the U.S., with a combined nameplate electric capacity of nearly 330 GW, corresponding to a net summer capacity of 303 GW.iv1 Many coal plants today have a nameplate capacity of over 500 MW, 1,000 times larger than Edison’s Pearl Street plant. Each plant consists of one or more generating units.
            </p>
            <p>
                The average U.S. coal-fired generator was 43 years old in 2013 (Figure 1).v Generating units are typically designed to last for at least 25 years with minimal modification. However, it is common to extend operational lifetimes to 40 years or more by replacing or upgrading components, since doing so is often far less expensive than building a new plant.vi In part because many existing U.S. coal plants were built in the 1960s and 1970s, the average fleet-wide plant efficiency of about 35% has remained largely unchanged for the past 50 years.vii
